      CH0063_MemorialLobby_1_1: Honestly, I've never understood people's fascination with the ocean.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_1_2: While everyone's having a good time, I've never felt the same way.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_2_1: It's blurry underwater, and I get nervous when my feet can't touch the ground.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_2_2: Sensei, have you ever felt that way before?
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_3_1: I find it eerie... The way the sea is just a bottomless well at night.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_3_2: I hate how it feels like I'll be sucked in just looking at it.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_4_1: But, you know, I think I'm beginning to understand. At least a little bit.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_4_2: The ocean can be so beautiful.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_5_1: It's a new feeling but it's interesting too.
      CH0063_MemorialLobby_5_2: Thank you, Sensei...for being here with me. And for everything you've taught me.
